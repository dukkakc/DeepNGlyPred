3. Please place the DNN Trained with N-GlyDE Dataset and Tested with N-GlyDE Independent Dataset.ipynb, DNN Trained with N-GlycositeAtlas Dataset and Tested with N-GlyDE Independent Dataset.ipynb, 447-feature_test.xlsx, 
   All_feature_Independent_dataframe.csv, trained models like 3080_NetSurfP2.0_PSSM_GD8.h5 and
   Concomitant13.h5 at the same directory where you will 
   execute the python program.
   
   
4. Run DNN Trained with N-GlyDE Dataset and Tested with N-GlyDE Independent Dataset.ipynb and DNN Trained with N-GlycositeAtlas Dataset and Tested with N-GlyDE Independent Dataset.ipynb to get obtain reported result


*** For your convenience Sample PSSM file of protein P48066 generated by PSI-BLAST, P48066.PSSM and NetsurfP file of protein B7Z4J0, B7Z4J0.fasta.csv has been uploaded   ***


If you need any further help and individual protein files generated by NetSurfP -2.0 and PSI-BLAST or if you want to predict N-link glycosylation then you can use the programs, furthermore, if you want the feature files to be generated by PSI-BLAST, NetsurfP.0, and Gapped Dipeptide or if you require any help please contact Dr. Dukka B. KC.

                                           *Thank You*
